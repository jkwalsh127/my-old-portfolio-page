## Description

This project was about setting up a personal portfolio page where I could write a short introduction about myself, link to projects I have completed or am currently working on, and provide ways for visitors to get in touch with me. The idea is to be able to have a working and growing site to be able to share with anyone interested, including potential employers. This site will always be a work-in-progress as I continue to add projects and accomplishments that I am most proud of.


## Essential Content

The site is meant to be very basic, with only one internally associated web page for visitors to land on. Nonetheless, links to my deployed projects as well as my networking pages will direct visitors away from the site by opening these links in a new tab. Functionally, this project is dominated by css to achieve an appealing layout. A little JavaScript was included to change the size of the header and its contents as the user scolls down from the top of the page.

The hero section informs visitors what can be found on the page, and also includes a photograph of the property where I do my gardening. This is included as a nice backdrop for visitors first making it to the page, while also being a reflection of a place and practice that is very dear to me. 

A fixed header includes my name as the main heading, and also a navigation menu for quickly jumping to one of the three main content sections found on the site, the 'about me', 'my work', and 'contact me' sections. 

The 'about me' section includes a short biography on my relevant work and education, as well as a quick list of a few hobbies of mine. A picture of me doing some woodworking in my barn is included. 

The 'my work' section is a flexible grid layout that provides links to and snapshots of my favorite programming projects I've completed (or have yet to complete). 

The 'contact me' section closes out the page with my google voice phone number, work email, and LinkedIn and Github profile links.
